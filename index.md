## About

Hosted at the University of Otago, the Bioinformatics Spring School 2022 is a week long training event for researchers, supported by [Genomics Aotearoa](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz) and the [New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI)](https://www.nesi.org.nz). This event is primarily targeted at researchers and students based in Aotearoa New Zealand. International applications will be considered but will need to be able to attend in-person. 

We will combine talks from researchers and hands on computational workshops (influenced by [The Carpentries](https://www.carpentries.org)), covering example workflows of DNA variant calling, Genome assembly, environmental DNA (eDNA), and Nanopore.

### When and where?

- 9:30 - 16:30, 21 November - 25 November 2022
- University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand

This is an in-person event.


Day | Topic
---|---
Monday | Introduction NeSI / Bash / R
Tuesday | Genomic variant calling
Wednesday | Genome assembly
Thursay | Environmental DNA
Friday | Nanopore

### Cost?

This event itself will only cost your time (there isn't a $ charge) and lunches will be provided. Attendees will need to fund all other travel related expenses.

### Is this for me?

This event is designed to give researchers (including students - 4th year and above) the opportunity to learn about and practice some bioinformatic skills. We'll be covering bioinformatic workflows such as:

- DNA variant calling from next generation sequence data
- Genome assembly
- Environmental DNA analysis

along with computational topics such as:

- Introduction to the Unix commandline (Bash)
- Introduction to R
- Introduction to working in a high performance computing environment (provided by NeSI)

This week long event is designed to be an immersive experience so **we ask that you commit to the entire week.** We have chosen to interleave the computational topics throughout the week so that we can build on them throughout the entire week, so this ensures participants have the key knowledge at the right time.


### Registration of Interest


**Please register your interest in attending by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoslCWhRq2qEj1CMLANPP1KQxOGaPZQLKSi8THoQQyNNMErA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

Applications close midnight 31st August (NZ). Applicants will be notified of their outcome the week following the close of applications.
